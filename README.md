# Introduction to Machine Learning

This repo holds the reports and code developed in Spring 2017 for the coursework based Introduction to Machine Learning course at Imperial College London. The course contained material similar to the described in the MOOC [Learning from Data](https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html). Each report answers a series of theory and practical problems proposed to develope and test the knowledge obtained. While the document with the requirements is not here provided the reports should be self explanatory.

## Code
The course was open to using any desired programing language. I used python which until then I had barely had contact with. I used it as an opportunity to learn a new versatile language. The main focus of the course was in reflecting on results rather than the programing itself. Add to that a really time constrained coursweork filled term and a new language and you get this __perfectly__ written code. Note the irony, I know the code is messy, a lot of things could be done better and it could do with a cleanup.

## Reports
The reports were all written in LaTex using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) which was also a new experience since I had never done latex before. The source code is still uploaded there. 

A quick summary of the reports' contents:

* Report 1:
  * Hoeffding's inequality
  * Perceptron algorithm
  * Hand written digit classification
* Report 2:
  * Empirical Risk Minimization
  * Bounds using VC dimensions
  * Structural Risk Minimization
* Report 3:
  * Epsilon optimal hypothesis
  * Cross Validation
  * Movie ratings' prediction (Netflix Challenge)
* Report 4:
  * Tykhonov regularization
  * Maximum margin linear Separator
  * Suport Vector Machines
  * Revised Digit Classification with SVM and PCA
